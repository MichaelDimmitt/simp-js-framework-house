## For when you need to reinvestigate a framework

## Example Usage: <image>

## Future Enhancements:
1) Project installs to home directory via a hidden folder, example: .simp-js-framework-house.
2) Alias added to rc file for `cd $HOME/.simp-js-framework-house; npm run <action> <app name>; cd -;`.

## Some Application Guarantees
1) The installer for these different frameworks will always be up to date.

## Usage example derived from the package.json:
```bash
npm install &&
npm run js-house-v name
```

## For what it is worth this could have been written as a bash script but that would not be as much fun
